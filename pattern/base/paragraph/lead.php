<p class="lead">The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. <i>Everyone realizes</i> why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have <b>uniform grammar</b>, pronunciation and more common words.</p>
